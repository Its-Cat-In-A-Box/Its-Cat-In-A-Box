- Ayo welcome to my page.
- Wait why are you here there isnt anything special on it
- I mean if your here then might as well check out some of my code
- Especially if you do spigot coding and kinda wanna just find some random stuff
- That feeling of you needing something but you don't know what it is, come here and you might find it
- Or if your just bored come on in and maybe you will find your new motivation
- Very important: My code is extremely beginner and be mean all you want but constructive comments make the cut easier
- Oh also I hard code everything in lmao because I only use it myself
